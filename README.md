## Intro
PitchVenture is an iOS application that connects commercial store owners with franchise or brand owners who want to establish a business by purchasing a franchise. Many brands and companies have established franchises in various regions of the world in recent years to expand their business, but there is a lack of a reliable platform where shop owners can communicate with franchise owners. This application will let store owners search different franchise and get full information on franchises and allow them to submit a proposal request for a franchise. The franchisor will be able to check the locations of shop owners and approve or reject their proposal. Once the franchisor has approved the proposal, the store owner can make a payment to finalize the agreement and receive the invoice.


## Version Control
I am going to be using a public repository in GitHub to track all of my changes and commits while I develop this app. I am currently in the **inception** phase. You can visit my *miro* site that is running live [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lwDvtnc=/). 



## Inception Phase
I am currently in the **inception** phase.

So far I have created repository, brainstorm my app idea and get feedback from others on my **miro** workboard and created UML Diagrams in **GenMyModel**.
